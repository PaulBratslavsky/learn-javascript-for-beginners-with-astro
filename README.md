# Building a Simple Card Carousel with Astro

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a simple card carousel using Astro. This carousel will display a series of images and titles, allowing users to click on a card to make it active and automatically cycling through the cards every few seconds.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML
- Node.js installed on your machine
- An Astro project set up

## Step 1: Setting Up the Project

First, create a new Astro project if you haven't already:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. Once your project is ready, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

## Step 2: Creating the Card Component

Create a new file named `CardCarousel.astro` in the `src/components` directory. This file will contain our card carousel code.
